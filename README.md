## Project analysis

### Target user profile
This curriculum is intended for any company interested in acquiring my services, preferably companies dedicated to programming and automation.

### Information architecture
I have structured my curriculum by dividing it into different sections explaining about myself, my academic background, and my knowledge of various programming languages. I have included a gray column with my contact information, such as my phone number, email, and address, along with my proficiency in Catalan, Spanish, and English.

### Visual design
I chose a broken white color as the background, which added an aesthetic touch along with the gray rectangle that blended perfectly with this white. For the font, I selected the first one that caught my eye.
